# RecruitBot
Recruit Bot is an intelligent automation tool designed to streamline and simplify the recruitment process. This project integrates RPA (Robotic Process Automation) using UiPath with a web-based candidate registration system built in Django. The bot automates essential recruitment tasks, significantly reducing manual effort and ensuring efficient communication with candidates.

Key Features:
Automated Data Entry: The bot extracts candidate information from an Excel dataset and populates candidate forms in a Django-based system, storing details directly in the database.
Email Automation: Recruit Bot automatically generates and sends emails to candidates, providing important updates such as their joining date and offer letter.
Seamless Integration: UiPath is used to handle repetitive tasks, such as data extraction and email communication, while Django manages candidate data and form submissions.
High Efficiency: The app automates around 80-90% of the recruitment process, improving speed, accuracy, and reducing human errors.
Scalability: Suitable for handling both small and large volumes of candidates, making it adaptable for various recruitment needs.
By leveraging both UiPath for automation and Django for data management, Recruit Bot ensures a smooth, fast, and reliable recruitment process, saving time and reducing costs.
